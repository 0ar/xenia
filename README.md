Xenia - Xbox 360 Emulator Research Project
==========================================

Xenia is an experimental emulator for the Xbox 360. It does not run games (yet),
and if you are unable to understand that please leave now.

Come chat with us in [#xenia @ irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23xenia&uio=MTE9NzIaa).

Currently supported features:

* Nothing!

Coming soon (maybe):

* Everything!

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. <b>It is not for enabling
illegal activity</b>. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).

## Quickstart

Windows:

    # install python 2.7 and VS2013
    git clone https://github.com/benvanik/xenia.git
    cd xenia
    xb setup
    # open build\xenia\xenia.sln and start xenia-run

When fetching updates use `xb pull` to automatically fetch everything and
update gyp files/etc.
