Xenia - Xbox 360 Emulator Research Project
==========================================

Xenia is an experimental emulator for the Xbox 360. It does not run games (yet),
and if you are unable to understand that please leave now.

Come chat with us in #xenia on freenode.

Currently supported features:

* Nothing!

Coming soon (maybe):

* Everything!

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. <b>It is not for enabling
illegal activity</b>. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).

    git clone https://github.com/benvanik/xenia.git
    cd xenia && source xeniarc
    xb setup
    xb build
    ./bin/xenia-run some.xex

## Building

See [building](docs/building.md) for setup and information about the
